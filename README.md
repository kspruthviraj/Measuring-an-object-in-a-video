# Detecting and measuring rice seeds. 

This is a python script to measure objects in a video with respect to a reference image. Note that in the GIF, the measurement is changing , and this is because of moving camera.

To run the code:

python Object_size_Video.py --input videos/Rice_video07.mp4 --output output/Rice_video07.avi --width 24.25


Here, width 24.25 is the width of left most reference object in the video. 

Example output:
